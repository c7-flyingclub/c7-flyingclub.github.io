testamonials:
- from: John O'Shaughnessy
  text: Cloud 7 is a huge part of my life. Having a cost effective fleet of six aircraft
    with a range of capabilities at my disposal canâ€™t be beat. Flying puts a smile
    on my face that sticks around well after the plane is back in the hangar.
- from: Paige Rudnick
  text: Cloud 7 has been a fantastic place to grow as a pilot. I joined as a low time
    private then worked my way up with the help of club instructors, and planes to
    become an instructor myself.
- from: David Johnson
  text: I honestly can't say enough about how great Cloud 7 is. When moving back to the area
    from out of state, finding a house near a good flying club was just as important to me as being close to work; 
    we likely wouldn't be in Eden Prairie if it wasn't for C7.
